# - Fullstack Application - 

## Description

This repository contains a fullstack application with separate frontend and backend directories. The project uses the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (or any other database)
- **Frontend**: React (or any other frontend framework)

The application is designed to be modular, scalable, and follows best practices for both frontend and backend development.

## Project Structure

```bash
fullstack-app/
├── backend/         # Backend architecture using Node.js and Express
├── frontend/        # Frontend architecture using React
├── README.md        # General documentation of the project
```

## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express. It follows a modular architecture, with the logic separated into controllers, routes, services, and models. The backend communicates with a MongoDB database and exposes a RESTful API.

For more details about the backend structure and setup, check the [backend README](./backend/README.md).

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React. It follows a component-based architecture and communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data.

For more details about the frontend structure and setup, check the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/fullstack-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd fullstack-app/backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
## Running the Application

1. **Backend**: To start the backend server, navigate to the backend directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

2. **Frontend**: To start the frontend development server, navigate to the frontend directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

3. The backend server runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default, and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will communicate with the backend using RESTful APIs.
