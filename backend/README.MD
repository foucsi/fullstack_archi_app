# Backend - Fullstack App

## Description

This is the backend of the Fullstack App. It is built with **Node.js** and **Express** and follows a modular architecture that separates the logic into controllers, routes, services, and models. The backend communicates with a MongoDB database and exposes a RESTful API.

The goal of this architecture is to provide a scalable and maintainable structure that can be reused in future projects.
